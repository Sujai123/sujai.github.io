<h1><font color="purple">Cafeteria:</font></h1>
<p>A café is a type of restaurant which usually serves coffee and snacks. The term "café" comes from French, and means "coffee".

You can read newspapers and magazines there, or chat with other customers about current topics. It is known as a place where information can be exchanged.

A café is sometimes called a coffeehouse or a coffee shop in English, a café in French and a cafe in Italian. (Cafe/café is the spelling in English, French, Spanish etc. But "caffe" is how the italian word foir coffee is spelled in that language.) It shares some of the characteristics of a bar, and some of the characteristics of a restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria, which is a type of restaurant where customers can choose from many dishes on a serving line. In some countries, cafes more closely resemble restaurants, offering a range of hot meals, and possibly being licensed to serve alcohol. British cafes however, do not sell alcohol.

In the Netherlands, cannabis-selling cafés face an uncertain future under a planned new law banning smoking in public places. The cafés, which attract millions of tourists each year, allow customers to buy marijuana over the counter and openly smoke it. In the United States, donut shops are also popular places to drink coffee and hang out.
